The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a set of core reusable low level features that enable Cartesian Robot (PPP) functionality. This implementation can be tailored to specific robotic applications that have a Cartesian Robot based movement.

The set of features include:
* State machine management
* Low level communication
* Independent simultaneous motor control
* Real-time trajectory generation
* Trajectory message handling
* Routine execution handling

Further improvements:
* Error handling
* Extending set of trajectory profiles
* Extending the motor type compatibility
* Closed-loop motor control

Hardware:
* Raspberry Pico (ARM Cortex M0 dual-core microcontroller)
* Custom board for interfacing the peripherals
* Stepper motor
